# WhiteLotus
WhiteLotus is a simple task and budget tracker. I made this because I want to get better
at handling my schedule and my finances. Both can be tough as a college student.
I know theres a bunch of software out there that can do it but I thought why not make my own.
For the time being the application lets you add tasks and things to a database the you set up I'll be
adding feature to help handle budget as well.

## Installation:
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
## Usage
 ```python
 python app.py
 ```
 change:
 ```python
 client = MongoClient("mongodb+srv://root:" + urllib.parse.quote("<your password>")+"@cluster0-8mszk.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true")
 ```
